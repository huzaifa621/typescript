### Notes

<details>
<summary>When I'm declaring a function with `const`, this is coming`Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'mergeSort'`</summary>
File Naming Conflict:
<br />
Ensure that you don't have another file in the same directory with the name mergeSort.ts or mergeSort.js. This could result in a naming conflict, causing the error.
